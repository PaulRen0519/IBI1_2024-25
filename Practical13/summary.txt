• A	statement	recording	which	of	these	two	sequences	are	most   closely	related.

The two sequences that are most closely related are the human SOD2 protein sequence (P04179) and the mouse SOD2 protein sequence (P09671). 
This conclusion is based on their high alignment score of 1097.0 and percentage identity of 90.09%, 
which indicate a strong sequence similarity consistent with their shared function as superoxide dismutase 2 enzymes in the mitochondrial matrix of closely related mammalian species. 
In contrast, comparisons with the random sequence yield negative alignment scores (-294.0 and -287.0) and a negligible percentage identity (4.05%), confirming a lack of relatedness.
